# Bookmark Project - Feature Development (Plan)

This project aims to develop a powerful bookmark manager with the following innovative features. Below is the feature list with estimated timelines and checkboxes to track development progress.

## Features

1. **AI-Powered Content Summarization**  
   - _Implementation_: Integrate NLP libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers or OpenAI's API) to generate summaries when users bookmark lengthy content.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement AI-Powered Content Summarization

2. **Contextual Recommendations Based on Current Workflow**  
   - _Implementation_: Track user browsing behavior (with permission) to suggest relevant content. Use algorithms for real-time recommendations based on saved bookmarks and browsing activity.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Contextual Recommendations Based on Current Workflow

3. **Semantic Search Across Bookmarks and Notes**  
   - _Implementation_: Implement semantic search using vector embeddings (e.g., BERT or SBERT) for meaningful query results. Use a library like Elasticsearch.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Semantic Search Across Bookmarks and Notes

4. **Collaborative Bookmarking and Notes**  
   - _Implementation_: Set up a sharing mechanism with permissions, allowing users to comment and contribute notes on shared bookmarks. Use Socket.IO for real-time updates.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Collaborative Bookmarking and Notes

5. **Time-Sensitive Bookmark Reminders**  
   - _Implementation_: Allow users to set reminders for bookmarks with notifications using cron jobs or a task scheduler like Agenda.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Time-Sensitive Bookmark Reminders

6. **Offline Access with AI Caching**  
   - _Implementation_: Store content for offline access using local storage or IndexedDB and implement caching for summarization and indexing.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Offline Access with AI Caching

7. **Interactive Visual Bookmark Explorer**  
   - _Implementation_: Create a graph visualization of bookmarks using libraries like D3.js or Vis.js, allowing users to explore connections.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Interactive Visual Bookmark Explorer

8. **Version Control for Notes and Bookmarks**  
   - _Implementation_: Track changes in notes and bookmarks, allowing users to view history and revert changes. You may need a diff algorithm for this.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Version Control for Notes and Bookmarks

9. **Dynamic Bookmark Organization with Tags and AI-Categorization**  
   - _Implementation_: Use AI to automatically tag and categorize bookmarks based on content analysis. Manual adjustment options should also be available.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Dynamic Bookmark Organization with Tags and AI-Categorization

10. **Sentiment Analysis for Saved Content**  
   - _Implementation_: Use sentiment analysis models to evaluate the tone of articles and provide insights. Display results visually.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Sentiment Analysis for Saved Content

11. **Smart Highlights and Takeaways**  
   - _Implementation_: Enable users to highlight sections and generate takeaways. Store highlights and annotations in the database.  
   - [ ] Task: Implement Smart Highlights and Takeaways
